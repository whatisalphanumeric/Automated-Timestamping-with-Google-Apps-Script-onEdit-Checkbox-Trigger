# Automated-Timestamping-with-Google-Apps-Script-onEdit-Checkbox-Trigger
This Google Apps Script automates timestamping in Google Sheets. When a checkbox in **Column D** is ticked, it records the current date and time in **Column F**. If unticked, the timestamp is cleared. This script uses the `onEdit` trigger to simplify tracking changes and reduce manual data entry.
